# Human or AI 🤖👤 (backend is down)

A real-time chat application that challenges users to distinguish between human and AI participants in anonymous 1-minute conversations.

## 🎯 Overview

- **60-Second Timer**: Precisely timed conversations to maintain engagement
- **Human vs AI Detection**: Challenge yourself to identify your chat partner
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant messaging powered by WebSocket technology
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, modern UI that works on all devices
- **AI Integration**: Sophisticated AI responses powered by Gemini AI
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your detection accuracy
